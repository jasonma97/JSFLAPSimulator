JSFLAP Simulator
Reads the Automata Definition output from JSFLAP.com (developed by Ben Grawi), and creates a Pythonic representation. Allows for testing via Python.

Future Features:
A converter from the JSFLAP output file to the .jff file format which JFLAP accepts. Allows to convert a JSFLAP output file into a file that JFLAP can then read and create.
Possibly add an option to save a JSFLAP file and create a new JSFLAP page with the same nodes/edges.
